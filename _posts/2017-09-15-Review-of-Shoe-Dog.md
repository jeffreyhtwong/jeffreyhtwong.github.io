title: Review of Phil Knight's Shoe Dog
---

Absolutely one of the best books I have read this year and probably one of the few books I will write a review for. I picked up this book on the recommendation of the Investor's Podcast and Bill Gates.

While Phil Knight describes himself as shy and introverted, it does not seem so based on this book (or maybe he has a great ghostwriter/editor). He does an incredible job of explaining the origins of Nike in detail. Despite exponential growth, Nike faces numerous financial and legal troubles in getting off the ground. The path to business success for Nike was a messy and chaotic journey filled with grit, passion, sacrifice, mistakes and struggle. Although the memoir does not contain explicit lessons to learn, Phil Knight tells an incredible story,

Knight gives a play by play of each year - the ups and downs, and the moments where he felt like he could lose it all. It honestly seemed like every year could have been the last for Nike (however, everyone knows that Nike is a behemoth today). This was the tension in this book that kept me hooked - it was built by the fragile nature of Phil Knight's finances and business, whether it was trying to obtain credit, asking for another loan from the bank to fuel purchases or their dealings with Onitsuka. Each year had uncertainty and yet, through determination and sheer luck, Nike still survived.

I liked how Phil Knight was very honest about how lucky he was in achieving business success. He was highly indifferent to the "Nike" name, and even preferred calling the company "Dimension Six". He also paid $35 to an art design student to design the Swoosh logo and did not believe that the design was anything special at the time. He also describes business and relationship challenges of starting a company and managing people, while being very upfront and vulnerable with his shortcomings as a father, husband and business person.

Overall, this book was inspiring and candid and provides a real glimpse of the determination required by entrepreneurs to get their company running.

There's a quote near the end of the book that I feel is a bit cliche, but strongly sums of Phil Knight's journey:

"I’d tell men and women in their mid twenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt."
